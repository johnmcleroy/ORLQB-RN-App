## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Module Structure Pattern:**
```
src/components/[ModuleName]/
├── index.js                 # Module exports
├── [ModuleName]Component.js # Main component
├── components/              # Sub-components
├── hooks/                   # Custom hooks
├── utils/                   # Utility functions
└── types/                   # TypeScript types (if added)
```

### **Shared Resources:**
- Firebase integration
- Authentication context
- Common UI components
- Shared styling patterns
- Cross-module data sharing

### **Role-Based Access:**
- **Guests:** Limited read-only access
- **Members:** Full member features + RSVP
- **Leadmen:** Management tools + reporting
- **Admins:** Full system access + configuration

---

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **Firebase Integration:**
- Real-time data synchronization
- Offline capability
- User authentication
- Role-based security rules

### **External Services:**
- Maps APIs (Google/Apple)
- Payment processing (for dues)
- Email/SMS services (notifications)
- Calendar sync (Google Calendar, etc.)

### **Cross-Module Communication:**
- Event system for module interactions
- Shared state management
- Common data models
- Unified notification system

## 📋 **Development Guidelines**

1. **Reusable Components:** Each module should export reusable components
2. **Role-Based UI:** Components adapt based on user permissions
3. **Offline Support:** Core functionality works without internet
4. **Consistent Styling:** Follow established design patterns
5. **Documentation:** Each module includes usage examples
6. **Testing:** Unit tests for critical functionality
7. **Performance:** Lazy loading for non-essential modules

This architecture provides a scalable foundation for the ORLQB mobile application, with clear separation of concerns and room for future growth.
