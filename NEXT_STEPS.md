## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies and Test (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/macbookpro/GitHub/johnmcleroy/ORLQB/RN_ORLQB_APP
npm install
npm start
```

**What You'll Learn**: 
- Expo development server
- QR code scanning with Expo Go app
- Hot reload in action

### 2. Test Basic Authentication (10 minutes)
1. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
2. Try creating a new account
3. Test login/logout functionality
4. See how Context API updates all screens automatically

**What You'll Learn**:
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Context API state management
- Firebase Authentication in action

### 3. Customize Styling (15 minutes)
- Modify colors in tab navigator
- Update app icons and splash screen
- Experiment with StyleSheet objects

**What You'll Learn**:
- React Native styling vs CSS
- Flexbox layout system
- Platform-specific styling

## ðŸ”§ Development Workflow

### Your New Development Process
1. **Start Development**: `npm start`
2. **Test on Device**: Use Expo Go app (no building required!)
3. **Make Changes**: Files auto-reload on save
4. **Debug**: Use React Native Debugger or browser tools

### Key Differences from Ionic
- **No Building**: Changes appear instantly on device
- **Native Performance**: 60fps animations out of the box
- **Simpler State Management**: React hooks vs Angular services
- **Component-Based**: Everything is a JavaScript component
